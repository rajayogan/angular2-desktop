When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\r\n * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nexports.Directive = decorators_1.makeDecorator(directives_2.DirectiveMetadata);\r\n// TODO(alexeagle): remove the duplication of this doc.

When the\r\n * directive's `selector` matches\r\n * elements in the DOM, the following steps occur:\r\n *\r\n * 1. For each directive, the `ElementInjector` attempts to resolve the directive's constructor\r\n * arguments.\r\n * 2. Angular instantiates directives for each matched element using `ElementInjector` in a\r\n * depth-first order,\r\n *    as declared in the HTML.\r\n *\r\n * ## Understanding How Injection Works\r\n *\r\n * There are three stages of injection resolution.\r\n * - *Pre-existing Injectors*:\r\n *   - The terminal {@link Injector} cannot resolve dependencies. It either throws an error or, if\r\n * the dependency was\r\n *     specified as `@Optional`, returns `null`.\r\n *   - The platform injector resolves browser singleton resources, such as: cookies, title,\r\n * location, and others.\r\n * - *Component Injectors*: Each component instance has its own {@link Injector}, and they follow\r\n * the same parent-child hierarchy\r\n *     as the component instances in the DOM.\r\n * - *Element Injectors*: Each component instance has a Shadow DOM. Within the Shadow DOM each\r\n * element has an `ElementInjector`\r\n *     which follow the same parent-child hierarchy as the DOM elements themselves.\r\n *\r\n * When a template is instantiated, it also must instantiate the corresponding directives in a\r\n * depth-first order. The\r\n * current `ElementInjector` resolves the constructor dependencies for each directive.\r\n *\r\n * Angular then resolves dependencies as follows, according to the order in which they appear in the\r\n * {@link ViewMetadata}:\r\n *\r\n * 1. Dependencies on the current element\r\n * 2. Dependencies on element injectors and their parents until it encounters a Shadow DOM boundary\r\n * 3. Dependencies on component injectors and their parents until it encounters the root component\r\n * 4. Dependencies on pre-existing injectors\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * The `ElementInjector` can inject other directives, element-specific special objects, or it can\r\n * delegate to the parent\r\n * injector.\r\n *\r\n * To inject other directives, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `directive:DirectiveType`: a directive on the current element only\r\n * - `@Host() directive:DirectiveType`: any directive that matches the type between the current\r\n * element and the\r\n *    Shadow DOM root.\r\n * - `@Query(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of direct child\r\n * directives.\r\n * - `@QueryDescendants(DirectiveType) query:QueryList<DirectiveType>`: A live collection of any\r\n * child directives.\r\n *\r\n * To inject element-specific special objects, declare the constructor parameter as:\r\n * - `element: ElementRef` to obtain a reference to logical element in the view.\r\n * - `viewContainer: ViewContainerRef` to control child template instantiation, for\r\n * {@link DirectiveMetadata} directives only\r\n * - `bindingPropagation: BindingPropagation` to control change detection in a more granular way.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * The following example demonstrates how dependency injection resolves constructor arguments in\r\n * practice.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * Assume this HTML template:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div dependency=\"1\">\r\n *   <div dependency=\"2\">\r\n *     <div dependency=\"3\" my-directive>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"4\">\r\n *         <div dependency=\"5\"></div>\r\n *       </div>\r\n *       <div dependency=\"6\"></div>\r\n *     </div>\r\n *   </div>\r\n * </div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * With the following `dependency` decorator and `SomeService` injectable class.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Injectable()\r\n * class SomeService {\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[dependency]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'id: dependency'\r\n *   ]\r\n * })\r\n * class Dependency {\r\n *   id:string;\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Let's step through the different ways in which `MyDirective` could be declared...\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### No injection\r\n *\r\n * Here the constructor is declared with no arguments, therefore nothing is injected into\r\n * `MyDirective`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor() {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with no dependencies.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Component-level injection\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject any injectable instance from the closest component injector or any of its\r\n * parents.\r\n *\r\n * Here, the constructor declares a parameter, `someService`, and injects the `SomeService` type\r\n * from the parent\r\n * component's injector.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(someService: SomeService) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a dependency on `SomeService`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from the current element\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on the current element.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(3);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with `Dependency` declared at the same element, in this case\r\n * `dependency=\"3\"`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a directive from any ancestor elements\r\n *\r\n * Directives can inject other directives declared on any ancestor element (in the current Shadow\r\n * DOM), i.e. on the current element, the\r\n * parent element, or its parents.\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Host() dependency: Dependency) {\r\n *     expect(dependency.id).toEqual(2);\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * `@Host` checks the current element, the parent, as well as its parents recursively. If\r\n * `dependency=\"2\"` didn't\r\n * exist on the direct parent, this injection would\r\n * have returned\r\n * `dependency=\"1\"`.\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of direct child directives\r\n *\r\n *\r\n * A directive can also query for other child directives. Since parent directives are instantiated\r\n * before child directives, a directive can't simply inject the list of child directives. Instead,\r\n * the directive injects a {@link QueryList}, which updates its contents as children are added,\r\n * removed, or moved by a directive that uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} such as a `ngFor`, an\r\n * `ngIf`, or an `ngSwitch`.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a {@link QueryList} which contains `Dependency` 4 and\r\n * `Dependency` 6. Here, `Dependency` 5 would not be included, because it is not a direct child.\r\n *\r\n * ### Injecting a live collection of descendant directives\r\n *\r\n * By passing the descendant flag to `@Query` above, we can include the children of the child\r\n * elements.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Query(Dependency, {descendants: true}) dependencies:QueryList<Dependency>) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a Query which would contain `Dependency` 4, 5 and 6.\r\n *\r\n * ### Optional injection\r\n *\r\n * The normal behavior of directives is to return an error when a specified dependency cannot be\r\n * resolved. If you\r\n * would like to inject `null` on unresolved dependency instead, you can annotate that dependency\r\n * with `@Optional()`.\r\n * This explicitly permits the author of a template to treat some of the surrounding directives as\r\n * optional.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({ selector: '[my-directive]' })\r\n * class MyDirective {\r\n *   constructor(@Optional() dependency:Dependency) {\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * This directive would be instantiated with a `Dependency` directive found on the current element.\r\n * If none can be\r\n * found, the injector supplies `null` instead of throwing an error.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Here we use a decorator directive to simply define basic tool-tip behavior.\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[tooltip]',\r\n *   inputs: [\r\n *     'text: tooltip'\r\n *   ],\r\n *   host: {\r\n *     '(mouseenter)': 'onMouseEnter()',\r\n *     '(mouseleave)': 'onMouseLeave()'\r\n *   }\r\n * })\r\n * class Tooltip{\r\n *   text:string;\r\n *   overlay:Overlay; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *   overlayManager:OverlayManager; // NOT YET IMPLEMENTED\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(overlayManager:OverlayManager) {\r\n *     this.overlay = overlay;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseEnter() {\r\n *     // exact signature to be determined\r\n *     this.overlay = this.overlayManager.open(text, ...);\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   onMouseLeave() {\r\n *     this.overlay.close();\r\n *     this.overlay = null;\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n * In our HTML template, we can then add this behavior to a `<div>` or any other element with the\r\n * `tooltip` selector,\r\n * like so:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <div tooltip=\"some text here\"></div>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Directives can also control the instantiation, destruction, and positioning of inline template\r\n * elements:\r\n *\r\n * A directive uses a {@link ViewContainerRef} to instantiate, insert, move, and destroy views at\r\n * runtime.\r\n * The {@link ViewContainerRef} is created as a result of `<template>` element, and represents a\r\n * location in the current view\r\n * where these actions are performed.\r\n *\r\n * Views are always created as children of the current {@link ViewMetadata}, and as siblings of the\r\n * `<template>` element. Thus a\r\n * directive in a child view cannot inject the directive that created it.\r\n *\r\n * Since directives that create views via ViewContainers are common in Angular, and using the full\r\n * `<template>` element syntax is wordy, Angular\r\n * also supports a shorthand notation: `<li *foo=\"bar\">` and `<li template=\"foo: bar\">` are\r\n * equivalent.\r\n *\r\n * Thus,\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *foo=\"bar\" title=\"text\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Expands in use to:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [foo]=\"bar\">\r\n *     <li title=\"text\"></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Notice that although the shorthand places `*foo=\"bar\"` within the `<li>` element, the binding for\r\n * the directive\r\n * controller is correctly instantiated on the `<template>` element rather than the `<li>` element.\r\n *\r\n * ## Lifecycle hooks\r\n *\r\n * When the directive class implements some {@link ../../guide/lifecycle-hooks.html} the callbacks\r\n * are called by the change detection at defined points in time during the life of the directive.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example\r\n *\r\n * Let's suppose we want to implement the `unless` behavior, to conditionally include a template.\r\n *\r\n * Here is a simple directive that triggers on an `unless` selector:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * @Directive({\r\n *   selector: '[unless]',\r\n *   inputs: ['unless']\r\n * })\r\n * export class Unless {\r\n *   viewContainer: ViewContainerRef;\r\n *   templateRef: TemplateRef;\r\n *   prevCondition: boolean;\r\n *\r\n *   constructor(viewContainer: ViewContainerRef, templateRef: TemplateRef) {\r\n *     this.viewContainer = viewContainer;\r\n *     this.templateRef = templateRef;\r\n *     this.prevCondition = null;\r\n *   }\r\n *\r\n *   set unless(newCondition) {\r\n *     if (newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || !this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = true;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.clear();\r\n *     } else if (!newCondition && (isBlank(this.prevCondition) || this.prevCondition)) {\r\n *       this.prevCondition = false;\r\n *       this.viewContainer.create(this.templateRef);\r\n *     }\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * We can then use this `unless` selector in a template:\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <li *unless=\"expr\"></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Once the directive instantiates the child view, the shorthand notation for the template expands\r\n * and the result is:\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * <ul>\r\n *   <template [unless]=\"exp\">\r\n *     <li></li>\r\n *   </template>\r\n *   <li></li>\r\n * </ul>\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Note also that although the `<li></li>` template still exists inside the `<template></template>`,\r\n * the instantiated\r\n * view occurs on the second `<li></li>` which is a sibling to the `<template>` element.\r\n */\r\nvar DirectiveMetadata = (function (_super) {\r\n    __extends(DirectiveMetadata, _super);\r\n    function DirectiveMetadata(_a) {\r\n        var _b = _a === void 0 ?

demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/snj7Nv?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {Component} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';\r\n * import {NgFor} from 'angular2/common';\r\n * import {HTTP_PROVIDERS, Http} from 'angular2/http';\r\n *\r\n * @Component({\r\n *   selector: 'app',\r\n *   providers: [HTTP_PROVIDERS],\r\n *   template: `\r\n *

.catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * The primary public API included in `HTTP_PROVIDERS` is the {@link Http} class.\r\n * However, other providers required by `Http` are included,\r\n * which may be beneficial to override in certain cases.\r\n *\r\n * The providers included in `HTTP_PROVIDERS` include:\r\n *  * {@link Http}\r\n *  * {@link XHRBackend}\r\n *  * `BrowserXHR` - Private factory to create `XMLHttpRequest` instances\r\n *  * {@link RequestOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseRequestOptions} class\r\n *  * {@link ResponseOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseResponseOptions} class\r\n *\r\n * There may be cases where it makes sense to extend the base request options,\r\n * such as to add a search string to be appended to all URLs.\r\n * To accomplish this, a new provider for {@link RequestOptions} should\r\n * be added in the same injector as `HTTP_PROVIDERS`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/aCMEXi?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {provide} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';\r\n * import {HTTP_PROVIDERS, BaseRequestOptions, RequestOptions} from 'angular2/http';\r\n

*   .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Likewise, to use a mock backend for unit tests, the {@link XHRBackend}\r\n * provider should be bound to {@link MockBackend}.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/7LWALD?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {provide} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';\r\n * import

providers to use the {@link Jsonp} service in any application.\r\n *\r\n * The `JSONP_PROVIDERS` should be included either in a component's injector,\r\n * or in the root injector when bootstrapping an application.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/vmeN4F?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {Component} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {NgFor} from

this.people = res.json();\r\n *     })\r\n *   }\r\n * }\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * The primary public API included in `JSONP_PROVIDERS` is the {@link Jsonp} class.\r\n * However, other providers required by `Jsonp` are included,\r\n * which may be beneficial to override in certain cases.\r\n *\r\n * The providers included in `JSONP_PROVIDERS` include:\r\n *  * {@link Jsonp}\r\n *  * {@link JSONPBackend}\r\n *  * `BrowserJsonp` - Private factory\r\n *  * {@link RequestOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseRequestOptions} class\r\n *  * {@link ResponseOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseResponseOptions} class\r\n *\r\n * There may be cases where it makes sense to extend the base request options,\r\n * such as to add a search string to be appended to all URLs.\r\n * To accomplish this, a new provider for {@link RequestOptions} should\r\n * be added in the same injector as `JSONP_PROVIDERS`.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/TFug7x?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {provide} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {bootstrap} from 'angular2/platform/browser';\r\n * import {JSONP_PROVIDERS, BaseRequestOptions, RequestOptions} from 'angular2/http';\r\n *\r\n * class MyOptions extends BaseRequestOptions {\r\n *   search: string = 'coreTeam=true';\r\n * }\r\n *\r\n * bootstrap(App, [JSONP_PROVIDERS, provide(RequestOptions, {useClass: MyOptions})])\r\n *   .catch(err => console.error(err));\r\n * ```\r\n *\r\n * Likewise, to use a mock backend for unit tests, the {@link JSONPBackend}\r\n * provider should be bound to {@link MockBackend}.\r\n *\r\n * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/HDqZWL?p=preview))\r\n *\r\n * ```\r\n * import {provide, Injector} from 'angular2/core';\r\n * import {JSONP_PROVIDERS,
